<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may be required to create
an account for one or more users to access the Services. You are solely
responsible for the activity that occurs within your accounts, and you
must keep your account passwords secure. You will be responsible for any
activities that take place under your accounts, or that take place on or
via any of your displays and other mediums. If you become aware of any
unauthorized use of your accounts or any other breach of security,
please notify us immediately. It is up to you to maintain the
confidentiality of your accounts. If any information that you provide
during registration is not accurate (or if we have reasonable grounds to
believe so), then as detailed further below under
&ldquo;Termination,&rdquo; we have the right to suspend or terminate
your account and refuse to grant you further access to the Service. You
further agree that whether you register an account or not you are at

Service</span></h5>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may offer certain Services
as closed or open beta programs (&quot;Beta Program&quot; or &ldquo;Beta
Programs&rdquo;) for the purpose of testing and evaluation. You agree
that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period
of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Programs. We will be the sole
judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer
the Beta Programs as commercial services. You will be under no
obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid Service as a result
of your subscription to any Beta Program. We reserve the right to fully
or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily
or permanently, any of the Beta Programs with or without notice to you.
You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for
any harm related to, arising out of, or caused by the modification,
suspension or discontinuance of any of the Beta Programs for any reason.</span></p>

able to opt out of most of these communications, but not others (such as
those concerning your account, displays, users and other administrative
or monitoring matters). We&#39;ll promise to keep notes from us at a
minimum (we don&#39;t like crowded inboxes, either!). If you don&rsquo;t
want to receive ANY messages from us, ever, you will need to cancel your
account. Sorry. And, of course, we promise to never ever ever rent or
sell your personal information, and you will never receive email from a
third party as a result of your relationship with us, unless we
explicitly ask and you explicitly opt in to do so.</span></p>

effect while you continue to use the Service. Either of us can Terminate
the Service for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, at any
time without liability for Termination. You may Terminate by ceasing to

together with any other agreements incorporated by reference or entered
into between you and us in connection with your registration constitute

may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when
you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.
If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of
Service it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any
reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable and such provision shall not affect the
enforceability of such provision under other circumstances, or the
remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. You agree that
regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms of
